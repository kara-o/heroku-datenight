# DateNight - Back End

DateNight is a single-page web-based application designed for couples/partners who need some sponteaneity when it comes to going out to eat. 

This is my final project completed during Module Five at Flatiron School.  It is a single page web application built with a Rails API backend and a [ReactJS front end](https://github.com/kara-o/DateNight-frontend).  The app is designed with separate user and admin interfaces.

### Built With

+ Ruby on Rails
+ PostgresQL database

### How to Run

Please install my [ReactJS front end](https://github.com/kara-o/DateNight-frontend) as well.

In your terminal navigate to the directory where you want to save the back end files, then enter and run each step:

1. `git clone git@github.com:kara-o/DateNight-backend.git`
1. `cd backend-datenight`
1. `bundle install`
1. `rails db:create && rails db:migrate && rails db:seed`
1. `rails s`
